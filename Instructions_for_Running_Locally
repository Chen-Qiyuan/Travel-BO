This repository contains the source code to reproduce all figures and experiments presented in our paper. We acknowledge that although we have fixed the random seeds for all experiments, the results may be slightly different depending on your hardware.

Prerequisites

Hardware:
All experiments were conducted on Google Colab with a High-RAM runtime.

Set up local environment:
To set up the environment for the experiments, run the following code in an Anaconda PowerShell prompt:

conda create --name travelbo python=3.10
conda activate travelbo
pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 torchaudio==2.6.0 botorch==0.13.0 cycler==0.12.1 gpytorch==1.14 matplotlib==3.8.2 openpyxl==3.1.2 pandas==2.2.0 scipy==1.12.0 pyarrow==15.0.0

Repository Structure:
- `main/`: Contains the code for experiments in the main paper. Inside, subfolders are organized by test function (e.g., `main/Griewank/`).
- `.../Figures/`: This folder is where all generated plots will be stored.
- `plot.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook used to generate plots from experimental data.
- `.../TEST_FUNCTION/METHOD.py`: Experiment of running algorithm `METHOD` on `TEST_FUNCTION`.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of all Python package dependencies.

How to Reproduce Our Results?

Shortcut to Reproduce Main Paper Figures (Figures 4-8): Please run the corresponding main/TEST_FUNCTION/figure.py. This will automatically run all the benchmark methods under the folder and create the plots.
